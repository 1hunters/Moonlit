> [**ToP**](./ToP) (```@KDD'23```): **Constraint-aware and Ranking-distilled Token Pruning for Efficient Transformer Inference**

## [**ToP**](./ToP/)

**ToP** is a constraint-aware and ranking-distilled token pruning method, which selectively removes unnecessary tokens as input sequence pass through layers, allowing the model to improve online inference speed while preserving accuracy.
